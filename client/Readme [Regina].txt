Hi! I am Regina from https://github.com/agatharejina
Very excited that I can participated on Hacktoberfest and contribute on this project.

These are the changes that I did:
- Imported a Nunito font from Google Fonts in public/index.html line 21
- Add Nunito font family in index.css
- Add 2 routes for Login and Sign Up pages in index.js
- Create and add folders for assets and components.
- Add global CSS in styles.css starting from line 38 (in case you want to separate it from yours in App.css)
- Add Icons from https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line
- Add SVG Vector Image from https://stories.freepik.com/
- Add a little bit of Javascript using React Hooks only to switch pages when button clicked.
- Add Forgot Password (Login.js), Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (SignUp.js) placeholder.

If there's any problem and would like to work with me, please contact me via my email -> agatharejinas@gmail.com

I hope you like the UI Improvement project by me. Cheers!
